   - E2E tests with Supertest and Playwright.
   - Demonstration of concurrent test execution for efficiency.

5. **Deployment Pipelines:**
   - **CI/CD Pipeline Generation:** Automated generation of GitHub Actions workflows to handle building, testing, and deploying the application.
   - **Containerization:** Docker Compose setup for consistent testing environments.
   - **Production Deployment:** AWS deployment scripts using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation.

6. **Dependency Management:**
   - Explicit library versions to ensure compatibility.
   - Use of Bun for fast dependency installation and script execution.

### **AI-Assisted Development Workflow:**

- **Ideation and Planning:** Use ChatGPT to outline project requirements and architectural components.
- **Code Generation:** Utilize Aider to scaffold project structure, generate server and client code, and set up testing frameworks.
- **Testing Setup:** Employ ChatGPT and Aider to create unit and E2E tests, integrating mocking strategies and concurrent test execution.
- **Deployment Automation:** Use Aider and ChatGPT to generate CI/CD pipelines that automate deployment to Docker Compose for testing and AWS for production.
- **Requirement Changes:** Introduce new features or modify existing ones, using AI tools to adapt code, tests, and deployment configurations seamlessly.
- **Optimization and Refactoring:** Leverage AI to enhance code quality, optimize performance, and maintain adherence to best practices.

### **Managing Requirement Changes:**

- **Initial Requirements:** Define core functionalities of the server and client.
- **Change Introduction:** Add new endpoints or modify existing client components based on evolving requirements.
- **AI Adaptation:** Use ChatGPT to assess the impact of changes and Aider to implement updates in code, tests, and deployment pipelines.
- **Artifact Matrix Maintenance:** Ensure all changes are reflected in the AI Artifact Matrix, maintaining consistency across use cases, code, tests, and deployment configurations.
